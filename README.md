# pq-demo
A demo using JCSMP and MQTT web messaging to show the behaviour of Solace partitioned queues.  And other queue types as well.

## Overview

This demo is meant to demonstrate a number of things:
- Partitioned Queues behaviour, with regards to consumers and rebalancing (more visual part)
- Proving / verifying per-key sequencing remains intact in a variety of scenarios (more behind-the-scenes part)


### Uses / Features

- Guaranteed messaging for all keyed and sequenced data going through the specified queue
- Direct messaging for all stats updates, control messages, and events
- MQTT websockets for the JavaScript dashboard
- REST messaging and or other support protocols for command and control (works in Î¼GW mode too)
- SEMPv1 and SEMPv2 usage for queue metrics
- Broker events-over-the-message-bus (e.g. `event.log` as topics) for watching broker state changes



## Quickstart Instructions

If you just want to get the demo running, and read all the details later, here you go... this will be about the quickest decent/reasonable setup.
Note this demo works for **exclusive** and regular **non-exclusive** queues too... often used to contrast differences in failover behaiour or ordering.  But save that for later.

### Prerequisites:
- JRE (to run) and JDK (to compile) v8 or greater
- Access to Solace broker
- For connecting to the broker with the graphical dashboard, and if accessing a non-localhost broker, either:
   a. the broker will need to be configured for TLS connections (meaning it has a server certificate, like Solace Cloud has); or
   b. you'll need an HTTP server to host the dashboard (lots of easy options, Python, Node)
         - I've used: `npm install http-server -g;  http-server . -p 8888`

### Broker setup
- enable `allow-any-host` in the broker's SEMP service.  CLI: `enable -> config -> service semp cors allow-any-host`
   - if using Solace Cloud broker, you'll need to contact Solace Support and tell them to enable this
- in your Message VPN settings, enable event publishing for VPN and client events.  CLI: `enable -> config -> message-vpn <blah> -> event publish-message-vpn -> event publish-client`
   - ensure that the broker is publishing events in MQTT format.  CLI: `event publish-topic-format mqtt -> end`
- Create a new partitioned queue, call it `pq12`.  CLI: `enable -> config -> message-spool message-vpn <blah> -> create queue pq12`
   - change the permissions to consume, access-type to non-exclusive, and number of partitions to 12. CLI: `permission all consume -> access-type non-exclusive -> partition count 12`
   - add a topic subscription to your queue to attract messages; let's use the queue's name as the root toipc level, and enable it.  CLI: `subscription topic pq12/> -> no shut -> end`
- Make sure you know:
   - SEMP / CLI username and passowrd (usually `admin/admin` on localhost brokers)
   - SEMP port (usually 8080 on software, or 943 on Cloud)
   - client-username and password for clients
   - MQTT WebSocket port (TLS if possible, usually 8443; otherwise plaintext, usually 8000)
   - SMF TCP port (55555 default, 55554 on Mac Docker usually), or 55443 for TCPS

### Terminal apps setup
- compile/build the Java project (instruction below): `./gradlew assemble`
   - goto `./build/staged`
- split your terminal into left and right
   - on the right, split it into 3 or 4 terminals (these will be the subscribers)
   - on the left, split it into 3 (top left will be publisher, middle will be state controler; bottom unused for now (will be order checker)
- start the StatefulControl app first, left side, middle pane: `bin/StatefulControl tcp://broker:55555 vpn username password`
   - this guy just keeps track of the current state of the demo for new apps as they join
   - you should see logging output on the console indicating that it connects to the broker, otherwise go debug your SMF connectivity
- start subs next: right side, top two panes, run `bin/PQSubscriber tcp://broker:55555 vpn username password queueName`
   - e.g. `bin/PQSubscriber localhost default foo bar pq12`
   - you should see them connect to the broker, and then receive a `FLOW_ACTIVE` event after 5 seconds if properly configured
- start publisher next: left side, top pane.  For this one, you need to know/remember the topic prefix you added to the PQ for it to attract messages.
   - e.g. `bin/PQPublisher localhost default foo bar pq12/`  (note the trailing slash... you need this; so if your topic you added to the queue was `demo/>`, then run publisher with `demo/` as last argument)
   - this will start the publisher nice and slow... 2 msgs/sec.  You should be able to see the subscribers receiving them, and based on key printed the partitioning should be working.
- you can now control the behaviour of the publishers and subscribers right here on the console!  In the left-bottom pane, run: `bin/Command`
   - this will print out all the commands that you can run in the StatefulControl app, to control the behaviour.
   - e.g. `rate 50` will increase the publish rate to 50 msg/same
   - `keys 1000000` will increase the number of keys used for the partition hashing from 8 (default) to 1,000,000.
   - `quit` tell all the messaging apps (everyone except for Stateful Control) to gracefully quit
- for ANY terminal app, tell it to **gracefully quit** by `Ctrl+C`
- for ANY terminal app, to **force kill** it instantly, press `Esc` and then `[ENTER]`.

### JavaScript GUI dashboard setup
- either try to use https://sg.solace.com/qr or you'll need a simple web server to host the files in `./src/dist/html`
- the deployed website will work if your broker is running on your localhost, or if it is configured for TLS (e.g. Solace Cloud)
   - otherwise, you'll get warnings on the developer console about mixed content. Specifically: "This request has been blocked; this endpoint must be available over WSS."
- if so, you'll need to run a simple web server.  Just Google how to do this, there are lots.
- if you provide no URL parameters, you should see the instruction for the page.  Essentially, you're going to take the 2nd long line of parameters near the bottom, and edit it for your broker.  E.g.:
```
https://sg.solace.com/qr/?queue=pq12&mqttUrl=ws://localhost:8000&user=default&pw=blah&vpn=default&sempUrl=http://localhost:8080&sempUser=admin&sempPw=admin
            URL            queueName          MQTT url + port     client-username & pw    vpn name                    SEMP port     SEMP user + SEMP pw
```
- at the bottom-left of the dashboard, if either of "MQTT" or "SEMP" don't connect, then check the developer console for any errors
- similar to the StatefulControl app, you can use the dashboard to publish messages to the demo to control its state (e.g. rates, number of keys, etc.)
- first pro tip: in the `control` drop-down menu, you can send your control message to one app specifically (e.g. make one subscriber slow), just note the app's name/hash to choose the right one


I think that's enough instructions to get started.  Play around with it... lots of neat things to see, but I don't want to overwhelm.  I will make an advanced section below for deep-dives.

## The Apps

The demo consists of 5 main components:

- **PQPublisher**: a Guaranteed messaging application that publishes messages containing keys and sequence numbers to a specified root topic prefix.  The runner of the demo (YOU) will ensure that the queue used in the demo has the appropriate topic subscription on it.  For example, if publishing on root topic `pqtest/`, the queue should have a matching subscription as `pqtest/>`.  Typically only one PQPublisher is run, but can support multiple at same time.


- **PQSubscriber**: a Guaranteed messaging application that will bind to the queue name specified on the command line (whether a partitioned queue, exclusive queue, or regular non-exclusive queue), and listen for demo messages specifically from the PQPublisher application.  It keeps track of all keys that it has seen (if Command.PROB > 0), and all the sequence numbers for those keys and echos an issues to the console and log file.  Both the Subscribers and the OrderChecker (below) use a `Sequencer` class to maintain this infomation.  Typically, multiple PQSubscriber applications are run simultaneously.


- **OrderChecker**: a "backend" process that is meant to listen to all of the outputs of the PQSubscribers and
verify the overall/global order of the data being put out.  This is done by the PQSubscribers publishing a "PROC" *processed* Direct message when they are ACKing a received message back to
the queue.  This simulates a database or processing gateway, and is to ensure that even during client application failures or consumer scaling, that global/total order is still maintained.
**The biggest/worst issue is if the `Sequencer` sees a gap, where a message on a particular key arrives but the previous sequence number on the same key has not yet.**  Typically, only one OrderChecker is run.


- **StatefulControl**: an optional utility that listens to all Control topics and maintains the current demo configuration state.  This allows "late joiners" or applications that connect later to find out the appropriate configuration.  Also very useful for providing CLI-like command entry.  Only one StatefulControl should be run.


- **The HTML / JS dashboard**: this GUI display provides a real-time view of the queue of interest and any connected clients.  The dashboard can be used on its own - without the PQPublishers or PQSubscribers - just to watch the stats of a queue, and will detect other Solace clients (like SdkPerf) binding to the queue it is watching.  For more information, check out the [README in the `src/dist/html` folder](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/pq-demo/tree/main/src/dist/html).


## Building

To build the applications, simply run:
```
./gradlew assemble
```
or on Windows Command Prompt:
```
.\gradlew.bat assemble
```

This will create a folder `build/staged` where the required JAR libraries, config files, and start scripts will be located.

This demo can be run entirely using the console apps, but it is better to also use the JavaScript dashboard to visualize what is happening.
See the README in `src/dist/html/`





## Running

There are a variety of ways to run this, but I will explain a super basic setup, and then a decent default configuration.

This deme will happily work with any queue type Solace offers, and can use it to show different things:

 - **Exclusive** queue
    - Connect multiple Subscribers, and bounce the active Subscriber's connection (basketball icon) to watch the failover happen
    - Increasing the ACK Delay, or increasing the SUB_ACK_WINDOW size, will increase the number of redeliveries the new active sees
 - **Non-Exclusive** queue
    - Turn on order checking (PROB > 0) and observe the errors with sequencing observed by the Subscribers, as it is just round-robin delivery
    - For a given use case, if each message is completely independent from all others, ordering doesn't matter, turn off order checking
 - **Partitioned** queue
    - Small number of keys will probably hash to not cover all partitions; larger number of keys will
    - Specify shell variable on Publisher before running to "hard code" list of keys, e.g.:
       - `export PQ_PUBLISHER_OPTS=-DforcedKeySet=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,15,36,41` evenly hash to a 12-partition queue
    - Set PROB to 0.99 and DELAY to 0 to have long strings of the exact same key in a row
    - Set PROB to 0.5 and DELAY to 10000 to have big gaps between next sequence on a key
       - This only works if number of keys is large, otherwise key will likely be chosen before 10 seconds is up
    - Set ACK Delay to 2000 ms and watch partitions back up a little bit
    - Set ACK Delay quite large, larger than queue's "max handoff" timer, and watch duplicate messages happen during consumer scaling
    - Set the queue's "Reject message to Sender even on Shutdown" setting, and then shutdown the queue's ingress: watch the Publisher get NACKs
    - Following the PQ partition scaling guide, change the number of partitions on the queue, watch what happens


### Super Basic

**Requirements:** 4 console terminals
 - 1 Publisher
 - 2 Subscribers
 - 1 Order Checker

[Check this part of my YouTube demo](https://youtu.be/CZC1wfHyABM?si=T7XZwqQ20dqGMH8e&t=132)

 - Start the Subscribers, and the Order Checker
 - Start the Publisher; by default it will start publishing with 8 keys at 2 messages per second, order checking disabled
    - The Subscribers will see the messages coming through, echoing each to the console
    - The Order Checker won't show anything because order checking is disabled
 - Use either REST messages on control topics, or the JS dashboard, to:
    - enable order checking: make PROB > 0
    - increase number of keys
    - increase message rate
 - If the publisher goes over 200 msg/s, it will switch the DISPlay to AGGregate view


### More Advanced

**Requirements:** 7 console terminals
 - 1 Stateful Control
 - 1 Publisher
 - 4 Subscribers
 - 1 Order Checker

![Terminals view](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/pq-demo/blob/main/readme/terminals2.png)

 - Start the Stateful Control first; this app will maintain the current config / state that you are applying so that 
apps that join later will get the current state from it
 - Start the Order Checker
 - Start 3 Subscribers
 - Start the Publisher; enable Order Checking PROB > 0, set KEYS to max, set rate to 500
 - All apps should switch into DISPlay AGGregate mode, since rates are too high
 - Add another Subscriber, watch failover happen
 - If you change the queue's "rebalance delay" and "max handoff" timers, reload the dashboard (Shift + F5) to force it to cache the current values
 

## Topics in Use

While this demo was originally written to just showcase the Guaranteed messaging features of Partitioned Queues, this demo makes extensive use of Solace Direct messaging for communication between applications, for statistics, events, control, and updates.

If you connect a regular Direct subscriber to the Solace event broker and just subscribe to `pq-demo/>`, you will see all the various control, state, stats, and processed messages flying around:

(May I suggest [this handy terminal app](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/pretty-dump) for listening to messages on Solace, and pretty-printing JSON and XML).


- `pq-demo/state/request`: when apps connect, they will attempt to request the current state from the StatefulControl app.  This is so late-joiners can be initiazlized with the same values and configuration as its peers.  If the StatefulControl app is not running, then apps will initialize with default values, but still listen to Control message updates from the event broker.
- `pq-demo/state/update`: when the StatefulControl app starts, and if it gets updated, it will publish a message on this topic that all apps are listening to, to "re-sync" their configuration state.
- `pq-demo/state/force`: only the StatefulControl app is listening on this topic, and can be used to inject a specific configuration after terminating/restarting the StatefulControl.  Helpful in testing.  The Stateful control app will echo its last known configuration to the loger when closing, 
- `pq-demo/control-all/<CMD>...`: all apps are listening to the `control-all` topics.  Not every app responds or cares about a specific message though. You will see this in the logging output of the app.  For example: publisher apps don't care about the `SLOW` slow subscriber Command, and subscribers don't care about the `RATE` message publish rate Command.
- `pq-demo/control-<APP_NAME>/<CMD>...`: a "per-client" unicast topic that each app subscribes to, that allows you to send a Command message to _just_ that one application.  For example, simulating a single subscriber going _bad_ by increasing its `SLOW` slow subscriber processing time, or how long it takes to ACKnowledge a message with the `ACKD` Command.
- `pq-demo/stats/...`: once a second, all publisher, subsriber, and OrderChecker apps will broadcast their statistics on these topics.  The JavaScript dashboard listens to these periodic message to update the stats shown on-screen.  At the same time, these statistics are logged.
- `pq-demo/event/...`: when a app has a SessionEvent or FlowEvent happen, they will log it and also publish a message. The JavaScript dashboard listens to some these messages to visually update the subscriber's status.
- `pq-demo/proc/<QUEUE_NAME>/<SUB_NAME>/<PQ_KEY>/<SEQ_NUM>`: these are messages published by the Subscribers, and are intended to be received the the backend OrderChecker.  In the Subscriber code, a message back to the queue can only be acknowledged once a successful `proc` message has been sent.  Note: this means that a Subscriber who loses their connection for some time might pubilsh an "old" message once it reconnects, and the OrderChecker will see a sequence change (but hopefully no gaps!).
- `$SYS/LOG/...`: (MQTT) this demo utilizes the Solace feature of publishing the broker's `event.log` as messages.  The JavaScript dashboard listens to these broker messages to visually update the applications' and partitions' statuses.


## Configuration Options

When running the demo, the publisher and subscriber applications will respond to a number of various commands.
These commands can either be injected via messages, or by using the StatefulControl console application.

To see the full list of commands that the applications can listen to, simply run the application called `Command`:

```
$ bin/Command
Shows all Commands that the PQ Demo responds to (using topics)

  QUIT:  Gracefully quit all running apps
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/quit'
  KILL:  Forcefully kill all running apps
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/kill'
  STATE: Have all running apps dump their state configuration
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/state'
  DISP:  Choose Console display type: each message, or aggregate
         Both,  1 param, string [each|agg], default=each,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/disp/agg'
  PAUSE: Pause or unpause publishing temporarily
         Pub,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/pause'
  RATE:  Publish messaage rate
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..10000], default=2,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/rate/300'
  KEYS:  Number of keys available (per-publisher)
         Pub,  1 param, 'max', or integer [1..2147483647], default=8,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/keys/1000, pq-demo/control-all/keys/max'
  PROB:  Probability of "follow-on" message (same key, next seqNum)
         Pub,  1 param, decimal [0..1], default=0.0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/prob/0.25'
  DELAY: Mean time in ms (scaled Poisson dist) to delay follow-on message
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..30000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/delay/2000'
  SIZE:  Size in bytes of published messages
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..100000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/size/1024'
  SLOW:  Slow consumer, mean time in ms (scaled Poisson dist) to take to "process" a message
         Sub,  1 param, integer [0..1000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/slow/50'
  ACKD:  Exact ACK Delay / Flush time in ms, for simulating batched processing
         Sub,  1 param, integer [0..30000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/flush/1000'

Use REST Messaging! E.g. curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pq-demo/control-all/rate/100
Use per-client topic with "-name" for individual control: 'pq-demo/control-sub-8312/slow/10'
Also, can force state with JSON payload:
  curl http://localhost:9000/pq-demo/state/force -d '{"PROB":0.5,"DISP":"agg","RATE":100,"KEYS":256}'
```

This help screen should help you understand the basics of what the demo can do.


### Control messages, and per-client Control

All applications are subscribed to the topic `pq-demo/control-all/>`, and will therefore receive any "[broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking))" Control message sent to all applications.

Each application is also subscribed to a unique Control topic using their name, such as `pq-demo/control-sub-1234/>` or `pq-demo/control-pub-2345/>`.  This allows you to send "[unicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast)" Control messages to just a single application.  


### QUIT - Graceful shutdown

Sending this Control message will cause all apps (except for StatefulControl) to begin a graceful shutdown.  This means that applications will have a chance to stop their publisher and consumer objects, acknowledge any outstanding messages, and quit nicely.

*Note*: when using the `ACKD` ACK Delay option for subscribers, the graceful shutdown period will be longer as there is an intentional delay before acknowledging consumed messages.  (In the future, maybe I will make all buffered messages ACK immediately during shutdown).

Pressing `Ctrl+C` on the terminal applications themselves will also initiate a graceful shutdown for that app, as will issuing a SIGTERM to the process.


### KILL - Instantly terminate

Sending this Control message will cause all apps (except for Stateful Control) to immediatiately* terminate.  This means that applications will not stop gracefully, all connections to the Solace broker will immediately close, and any unacknowledged messages will be made available for redelivery.  *Note that if a subscriber is slow (see below) it might not get the Kill message right away.

Pressing `Esc` and then `Enter` on the terminal applications themselves will instantly kill the app.


### STATE - (All) Echo current State

Each running app will echo their current state (configuration) to the console.  This can be useful for verifying things, or for cutting-and-pasting back into another test run with the "force state" command.


### DISP - (All) Change between showing each message or aggregate stats

String "each"|"agg".  Default = "each".  When running the terminal applications, sometimes you want to see *each* individual message echo'ed to the console, but as rates go up you would prefer these statistics *agg*regated.  Each message is always logged to the logging files, which essentially gives you an audit record of everything the Publishers, Subscribers, and OrderChecker have seen.


### PAUSE - (Pub only) Pause publishing

This publisher-only command toggles publishers between sending and not-sending messages.  This can either be broadcast to all publishers using the `control-all` topic, or to individual publishers by specifying their specific name in the Control topic.  In the dashboard, each publisher has a "pause" button.

### RATE - (Pub only) Change message pubish rate

This Command changes how quickly publishing applications send events to the broker, to the queue. Great care was taken with timing each loop and using Java's `Thrad.sleep()` method that has nanosecond accuracy to help ensure a consistent publish rate is achieved.  This isn't always possible due to thread/process scheduling or priority, but the publisher apps are coded to try to maintain a consistent publishrate


### KEYS - (Pub only) Change the number of keys published on

Integer between 1 and 2^31 (~2.1B); or "max".  Default = 8.

Each publisher has a certain number of keys that it is configured to publish on.  In Solace, Partitioned Queues keys are Strings, so the publishers specify their keys as follows: `<2-chars>-<hex-seqNum>` where the first two chars are the last two numbers of their PID, and the PQ key is expressed as a hexidecimal number.  So for example, if a publisher is called `pub-1234`, and its keyspace size is 16 (only one digit in hex), then one of its partition keys could look like `34-e` or `34-0` (for key #14 and #0 respectively).

Adding something unique from the publisher to the key name is in case multiple publishers are sending.


### PROB - (Pub only) Probability that the publisher will resend this particular PQ key at some point

Decimal number between 0 and 1 inclusive, default = 0.  This number is the likelihood that a "follow-on" message (aka a message with the same PQ key but the next sequence number) will be published at some point in the future.  Note that if using a small-ish number of keys, it is quite likely that a resend will occur anyway; only when using a huge keyspace will this ensure the same key is picked again.

Setting to 0 disables all sequenced checks in the Subscribers and the OrderChecker.


### REQD - (Pub only) Mean time in ms that the publisher will wait before requeuing to send

Related to `PROB` above, this is the approximate time the publisher will wait before sending the follow-on message with the same key.  The default value of 0 means that if the probability check is met, the next message published wlll be the same key.  Or, as an example, if the delay is 5000ms, then this particular key will put into the resend queue to be sent with the next sequence number in approximatlely* 5 seconds. *see Scaled Poisson section




### SIZE - (Pub only) How big the message is

Integer between 0 and 100,000.  Default = 0.  Completely unused in the demo, this is simply to drive bandwidth rates and broker performance.


### SLOW - (Sub only) Add slow-subscriber millisecond delay to message callback

Integer between 0 and 1,000.  Default = 0.  This will add an approximate slowdown/sleep/pause in milliseconds in the message callback thread of the Subscriber, simulating processing load.  The value is somewhat randomized, utilizing a scaled Poisson distribution.

Note that the Subscriber does not perform any intelligent flow control, and that its ingress buffers ([dispatch notification queue](view-source:https://docs.solace.com/API/API-Developer-Guide/API-Threading.htm#api_threading_1096948177_601598)) can easily become backed-up with messages with an appropriate large delay, and Direct and Guaranteed messages use the same buffers.  For example, a slow subscriber delay of 100ms means that it will take ~25 seconds to clear its entire window's worth of messages (default AD SUB WIN = 255).  So if a control message is sent to a slow subscriber, it make take a few seconds to be processed if it is stuck behind a number of Guaranteed messages that must be "processed" by the app.

!(Receiving messages in JCSMP)[https://docs.solace.com/API/API-Developer-Guide/Images/java_receive_threading_async.jpg]


### ACKD - (Sub only) ACKnowledgement Delay

Integer between 0 and 30,000. Default = 0.  This setting tells the Subscriber to "buffer" the message for some number of milliseconds before a) sending a message to the backend OrderChecker (for global order checking); and b) acknowledging the message back to the broker.  A larger value means that in case of Subscriber failure (or KILL), more messages will have to be redelivered to the next Subscriber that takes over.

Note that when performing a graceful quit, the Subscriber will delay how long it takes to shutdown 



## Apps

This section details the various application components of the demo.

### StatefulControl

This app is not actually necessary to run the demo.  However, it does provide a way for "late joiners" to receive the currently configured state when they connect to the Solace event broker.  Whenever Control messages are sent, apps will receive and act on Commands that they are interested in.  The StatefulControl app maintains these settings and will provide the "current state" for any appications that joins after the Control messages have been sent.

Note that the `QUIT` and `KILL` commands are not acted on by the StatefulControl app.  Only publisher, subscriber, and OrderChecker apps will respond to these.  This lets you terminate an existing setup, and restart the apps with the same state, as they will request the configuration when they start up.



### PQPublisher

The publisher application has the most number of configurable options.  In addition to the various Commands listed above, the publisher apps can startup with a specified `AD_PUB_WINDOW` size.  This SMF parameter is not tunable during runtime and must be specified at startup, hence why this ia a program argument.  The default value for the application is 255 messages (vs. JCSMP default of 1 message).  255 messages allows a high volume/throughput of messages over a longer RTT (Round-Trip Time) link.  Changing to a lower value could/will impact throughput.

The publisher application keeps a list of all keys that it has published on, and the associated sequence numbers with them.


### PQSubscriber




### OrderChecker


## Scaled Poisson

Quite a few of the "random" values in this demo follow a modified Poisson distribution.  This gives more interesting numbers than a uniform or normal distribution, but also has a known average / mean value.

For example, a SLOW subscriber delay of 10ms actually has a distribution that looks like this:
