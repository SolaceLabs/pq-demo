# pq-demo
A demo using JCSMP and MQTT web messaging to show the behaviour of Solace partitioned queues

## Overview

This demo is meant to demonstrate a number of things:
- Partitioned Queues behaviour, with regards to consumers and rebalancing
- Prooving / verifying 




## The Apps

The demo consists of 5 main components:

- PQPublisher: a Guaranteed messaging publishing application that 


- PQSubscriber: 


- OrderChecker: a "backend" process that is meant to listen to all of the outputs of the PQSubscribers and
verify the overall/global order of the data being put out.


- StatefulControl: a utility that 



- The HTML / JS dashboard: this GUI display provides a real-time view of the queue of interest and any connected clients.
It is


## Building

To build the applications, simply run:
```
./gradlew assemble
```
or on Windows Command Prompt:
```
.\gradlew.bat assemble
```

This will create a folder `build/staged` where the required JAR libraries, config files, and start scripts will be located.






## Running





## Configuration Options

When running the demo, the publisher and subscriber applications will respond to a number of various commands.
These commands can either be injected via messages, or by using the StatefulControl console application.

To see the full list of commands that the applications can listen to, simply run the application called `Command`:

```
$ bin/Command
Shows all Commands that the PQ Demo responds to (using topics)

  QUIT:  Gracefully quit all running apps
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/quit'
  KILL:  Forcefully kill all running apps
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/kill'
  STATE: Have all running apps dump their state configuration
         Both,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/state'
  DISP:  Choose Console display type: each message, or aggregate
         Both,  1 param, string [each|agg], default=each,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/disp/agg'
  PAUSE: Pause or unpause publishing temporarily
         Pub,  0 params,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/pause'
  RATE:  Publish messaage rate
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..10000], default=2,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/rate/300'
  KEYS:  Number of keys available (per-publisher)
         Pub,  1 param, 'max', or integer [1..2147483647], default=8,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/keys/1000, pq-demo/control-all/keys/max'
  PROB:  Probability of "follow-on" message (same key, next seqNum)
         Pub,  1 param, decimal [0..1], default=0.0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/prob/0.25'
  DELAY: Mean time in ms (scaled Poisson dist) to delay follow-on message
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..30000], default=1000,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/delay/2000'
  SIZE:  Size in bytes of published messages
         Pub,  1 param, integer [0..100000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/size/1024'
  SLOW:  Slow consumer, mean time in ms (scaled Poisson dist) to take to "process" a message
         Sub,  1 param, integer [0..1000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/slow/50'
  ACKD:  Exact ACK Delay / Flush time in ms, for simulating batched processing
         Sub,  1 param, integer [0..30000], default=0,  e.g. 'pq-demo/control-all/flush/1000'

Use REST Messaging! E.g. curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pq-demo/control-all/rate/100
Use per-client topic with "-name" for individual control: 'pq-demo/control-MDwh0VxT7E/slow/10'
Also, can force state with JSON payload:
  curl http://localhost:9000/pq-demo/state/force -d '{"PROB":0.5,"DISP":"agg","RATE":100,"KEYS":256}'
```
